All notable changes to this plugin will be documented in this file.

[//]: # (The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]&#40;https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/&#41;, and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]&#40;https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html&#41;.)

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `NotesPlugin`: notes in the editor, in two tabs. Scene notes are serialized (saved in the viewer config and in an exported .glb); page notes are kept in `localStorage`, and on a server with `syncUrl`. "+ Context" adds the time and the names of the selected objects. Its UI folder is `Notes`; the `notes-plugin` example and the Extras mode of the tweakpane editor example show it.

### Changed

- treejs comes from npm, `@repalash/treejs` 2.0.0 (the same code), instead of a git URL, which npm 12 refuses by default. `HierarchyUiPlugin.treeView` is typed `any`: treejs is bundled, so its type could not resolve in consumer declarations.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Add pivot controls and pivot edit toolbar buttons with toggle support
- Add pivot edit icon (`pivotEdit`) to icon set

### Changed

- `HierarchyUiPlugin` — support Shift/Ctrl/Cmd click for multi-select in hierarchy panel via `PickingPlugin.toggleSelectedObject`
- `HierarchyUiPlugin` — skip hierarchy rebuild for widget and widget root object changes to avoid unnecessary UI refreshes
